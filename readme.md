Product Kit Core provides design tokens according to the Daimler TSS styleguide. These tokens are used to create an export that can be used on web platforms using material design. The export is created with a build tool that is called [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary).

You can use the export to apply the styling by yourself or use one of the following implementations for react or angular:
* [Web](https://github.com/daimler/product-kit_web)
* [Angular](https://github.com/daimler/product-kit_angular)

The export can be extended to support other platforms like iOS or Android. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Daimler/product-kit_core/issues) or provide a pull request with the desired export.

## Usage
*Note that you must have node (and npm) installed.*

You can get the style dictionary for web as package through npm:
```bash
$ npm install @daimler/productkit-core
```
This package currently includes *.css and *.scss exports of the design tokens to be included in your web frontend. Exports can be found in the `exports` directory.

If you don't want to use the npm package clone the repository and get the files from the `exports` directory directly.
